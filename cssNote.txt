- CSS?
  - CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
  - CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
  - CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
  - External stylesheets are stored in CSS files


- solved problem by css -> 
  - HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!
  - HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, 
  - CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!

-  structure of css -> 
  - selector -> h1, h2 etc
  - declaration block -> {property:value; property:value}

- A CSS selector selects the HTML element(s) you want to style. 
- classification of selectors -> 
  - Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
  - Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
  - Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
  - Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
  - Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)

- universal selector (*) -> select all elements in HTML script

- simple selectors -> 
  - name -> based name element(s)
  - class -> based class name -> several elements can contain same class name -> select specified element -> 
    - name of elemenr(for example p).class name -> p.className
  - id -> based id name -> single element can contain id name -> select id -> 
    - #id name -> #idName


- grouping selectors -> the elements with the same declaration block -> use grouping selectors ->
  - h1,h2 {}
