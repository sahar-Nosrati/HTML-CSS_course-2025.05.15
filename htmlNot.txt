- HTML -> 
  - HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
  - HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
  - HTML describes the structure of a Web page

  - HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

explanation of simple HTML document -> 
  - The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
  - The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
  - The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
  - The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
  - The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.


- HTML element -> An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag
- point -> Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!

- note -> Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag! 

- <!DOCTYPE html> declaration -> present the type of the page and helps browser to display web page correctly. It appers once at top of the script 

- Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements.
- <img src="" alt="">
- HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.
- HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.
- The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed

- specify the URL in the src attribute:
  -  Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website

- src attribute -> The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed
- The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specify the width and height of the image (in pixels)
- The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed

- lang attribute inside the <html> tag ->  to declare the language of the Web
- points -> Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang attribute. So, the first two characters define the language of the HTML page, and the last two characters define the country.

- title attribute -> some extra information about an element

- best practice for attribute ->
  - to lowecase
  - inside single or duble qutes (double qutes is better)

- HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.

- hsl(hue, saturation, lightness) -> 
  - Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.
  - Saturation is a percentage value. 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color. ->

- CSS -> stands for cascading style sheet -> to format the layout of a webpage 
- Tip: The word cascading means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements within the parent.

    - the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination

- format of links -> 
  - An unvisited link is underlined and blue
  - A visited link is underlined and purple
  - An active link is underlined and red

- Opening the link -> open in current page -> to change current page -> use target attribute -> The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document -> 
  - _self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
  - _blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
  - _parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
  - _top - Opens the document in the full body of the window

- URLs -> 
  - absolute URL ->  a full web address in the href attribute

- Bookmarks can be useful if a web page is very long.

- With HTML image maps, you can create clickable areas on an image.
- HTML <map> tag -> create clickable area on an image -> create area ->
  - areas -> defines one or more <area> 

- create image map steps -> 
  - create name usemap for img -> it should be defined by #
  - create map  with attribute of name -> 
    <map name=""> -> usemap name will be used without # -> 
    - create area tag -> <area shape = "" coords="" alt="" href="">
    - create area tag -> <area shape = "" coords="" alt="" href="">
    - create area tag -> <area shape = "" coords="" alt="" href="">
    </map>

- coords="" -> for circle -> coordinate of center (distance from left margin, distance from top margin), radious -> example -> (120, 25, 15)
- coords="" -> for rect -> coordinate of first point in top of shape (distance from left margin, distance from top margin), coordinate of second point in button of shape (distance from left margin, distance from top margin) -> example (50, 120, 200, 50)
- coords="" -> for rect -> coordinate of first point in top of shape (distance from left margin, distance from top margin), coordinate of second point in button of shape (distance from left margin, distance from top margin) -> example (50, 120, 200, 50)

- body {
  background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-attachment: fixed; -> to be sure the background image will cover the entire element, with no stretching 
  background-size: cover;
}


- Reasons for usage of <picture> </picture> ->
  - 1. Bandwidth -> in small screen and device -> browser will select first <source> with appropriate attribute and ignores other source 
  - 2. Format Support -> browser or devices can not support image format -> possibility addition images with different formats browser will use the first format, and ignore any of the following elements.
